My name is Ivan Vasilev. I’ve always been good at math and science that’s why I graduated  as a mechanical engineer. After many years working in the logistics, I decided to learn web development. So I came into the world of WEB. Relatively quickly I learned the basics, because I think logically and I understand the technical part of the projects. I developed some projects and continue to improve them. I also made without a budget their SEO-optimization.

I would love to participate in larger projects, to work in a team of developers where I would be able to enlarge my current skills and knowledge and learn new technologies. Currently I am looking for a full time job, but I would be glad also to join freelance projects.

If you find my portfolio and my projects interesting, please contact me.
