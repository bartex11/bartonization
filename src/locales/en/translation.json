    "Story": "Hello, my name is Ivan Vasilev. I live and work by the mantra \"Never stop learning...\" I’ve always been good at math and science that’s why I graduated as a mechanical engineer. After many years working in the logistics, I decided to learn web development. I find great interest in all new digital technologies and latest design practices. So I came into the world of WEB. Relatively quickly I learned the basics, because I think logically and I understand the technical part of the projects. I developed some projects and continue to improve them. I also made without a budget their SEO-optimization.",
